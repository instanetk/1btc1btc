1BTC=1BTC is a digital art project exploring Bitcoin as its own unit of account.
Generate AI-powered philosophical analogies and mint them as fully on-chain SVG NFTs on Base.
Each mint costs 10,000 sats — and the contract is capped at 10,000 NFTs.
Therefore only 100,000,000 sats can be raised from this project: **1 BTC.**
