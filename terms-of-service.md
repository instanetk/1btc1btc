# 1BTC1BTC.money — Terms of Service

*Last updated: February 17, 2026*

By accessing 1BTC1BTC.money (the "Site") or interacting with the OnebtcOnebtc smart contract on Base (the "Contract"), you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the Site or mint any tokens.

## 1. What This Project Is

1BTC1BTC.money is a digital art project that generates philosophical analogies about Bitcoin as its own unit of account. Analogies are generated using AI (Anthropic Claude) and displayed ephemerally on the Site. Users may choose to permanently record ("mint") an analogy as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the Base blockchain.

**This is an art and collectibles project. The NFTs produced by this project are digital collectibles — not investments, securities, financial instruments, or stores of value.** Nothing on this Site or in these Terms should be construed as financial, investment, tax, or legal advice.

## 2. What You Receive When You Mint

When you mint an analogy, you receive an ERC-721 token on the Base blockchain. The token contains:

- A fully on-chain SVG image embedding the analogy text, the 1BTC=1BTC logo, and generative orbital artwork seeded by the token ID.
- On-chain metadata (name, description, and SVG image) encoded in the token's `tokenURI`, with no dependency on external hosting or IPFS.

You receive **ownership of the token itself**. You do not receive any intellectual property rights, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights in the underlying analogy text, artwork, logo, or brand. The token grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to display the associated SVG artwork for non-commercial purposes. This license transfers with the token if you sell or transfer it.

## 3. AI-Generated Content

Analogies displayed on the Site and embedded in minted tokens are generated by an AI language model (Anthropic Claude). The copyright status of AI-generated text in the United States is currently unsettled. The U.S. Copyright Office has generally declined to register works produced autonomously by AI without sufficient human authorship. As a result, the analogy text embedded in your token may not be eligible for copyright protection.

You acknowledge this uncertainty and agree that no representation is made regarding the copyrightability or exclusivity of any analogy text.

## 4. Pricing and Payment

Each mint costs 10,000 satoshis worth of ETH, determined dynamically at the time of minting using Chainlink cbBTC/USD and ETH/USD price feeds on Base. You pay in ETH. Any excess ETH sent beyond the required mint price is automatically refunded by the Contract.

Prices may fluctuate between the time you initiate a transaction and the time it is confirmed on-chain. You are responsible for ensuring your wallet has sufficient ETH to cover both the mint price and network gas fees.

**All sales are final.** Due to the immutable nature of blockchain transactions, minted tokens cannot be returned, refunded, or reversed.

## 5. Upvoting

The Contract includes an on-chain upvoting mechanism limited to one vote per wallet address per token. Upvotes are used solely for sorting and display purposes within the Site gallery. Upvotes do not confer governance rights, economic rights, or any form of decision-making authority over the project.

## 6. Secondary Sales and Royalties

The Contract implements ERC-2981, specifying a 25% royalty on secondary sales payable to the contract owner. Whether this royalty is honored depends on the marketplace where a secondary sale occurs — many marketplaces have reduced or eliminated creator royalty enforcement.

You are free to sell or transfer your token on any compatible marketplace or directly via the blockchain. The project makes no representations about the resale value of any token. Most NFTs have no secondary market value.

## 7. Risks You Accept

By using the Site and minting tokens, you acknowledge and accept the following risks:

**Smart contract risk.** The Contract has been developed with care, including reentrancy guards and input validation, but it has not been formally audited by a third-party security firm. Smart contracts may contain bugs or vulnerabilities that could result in loss of funds or tokens.

**Oracle risk.** Mint pricing depends on Chainlink price feeds. The Contract includes a 1-hour staleness check, but price feeds may become temporarily unavailable, inaccurate, or manipulated in ways that affect the mint price.

**Blockchain risk.** Transactions on Base (and Ethereum L1) are irreversible. You are solely responsible for the security of your wallet, private keys, and seed phrases. Lost keys cannot be recovered, and stolen tokens cannot be returned.

**Volatility risk.** The value of ETH and BTC fluctuates. The fiat-equivalent cost of minting may change significantly in short time periods.

**Regulatory risk.** The legal and regulatory status of NFTs is evolving across jurisdictions. Future laws, regulations, or enforcement actions could affect your ability to hold, transfer, or sell tokens, or could impose obligations on you as a token holder.

**No guarantee of availability.** The Site (including the analogy generation API and gallery) is provided as-is and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time without notice. Because token metadata is stored fully on-chain, your token's SVG artwork and analogy text will remain accessible via the blockchain regardless of the Site's availability.

## 8. Prohibited Uses

You agree not to:

- Use the Site or Contract for money laundering, terrorist financing, or any other illegal activity.
- Attempt to exploit, manipulate, or interfere with the Contract, oracle feeds, or Site infrastructure.
- Use automated systems to generate or mint analogies at scale in a manner that degrades the service for others.
- Represent any token as an investment opportunity or security.

## 9. Data and Privacy

The Site collects minimal data:

- **Wallet addresses** are inherently public on the blockchain. The Site reads on-chain data (minted tokens, upvotes) to populate the gallery.
- **IP addresses** are used transiently for rate limiting (1 request per IP per 3 seconds on the generation endpoint) and are not stored long-term.
- **Unminted analogies** are stored in a database (MongoDB) and associated with a session, not with a wallet address or personally identifiable information.
- **Analytics**, if enabled, are collected via self-hosted Plausible Analytics, which does not use cookies or collect personal data.

No personal data is sold to or shared with third parties.

## 10. Taxes

You are solely responsible for determining and fulfilling any tax obligations arising from your purchase, ownership, sale, or transfer of tokens. This may include income tax, capital gains tax, sales tax, VAT, or other taxes depending on your jurisdiction. The project does not provide tax reporting, withholding, or documentation such as 1099 forms.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the project, its creator(s), and contributors shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, tokens, data, or digital assets, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from your use of the Site or Contract.

Total aggregate liability, if any, shall not exceed the amount of ETH you paid to mint the specific token(s) at issue.

## 12. No Warranty

The Site and Contract are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

## 13. Modifications

These Terms may be updated at any time. Material changes will be indicated by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the Site after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. On-chain interactions with the Contract are governed by the Terms in effect at the time of the transaction.

## 14. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Florida, United States, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Florida.

## 15. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.
